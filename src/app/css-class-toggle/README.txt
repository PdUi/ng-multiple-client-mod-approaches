“CSS” Approach
Views all contain the same areas/components.
Needs a few pieces that are shown/hidden or realigned.
All visual modifications could be accomplished cleanly/responsively with css.
In ALL components, should be able to tweak colors with css as well(buttons, headers, text)
Is all in project, no config to be stored in db.
