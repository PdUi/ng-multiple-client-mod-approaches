“dynamic” Approach
All components would need to be 'entry components'.
All would most likely need to be tied to some identifier(instance of string?) and each routed view would need to be given a list of identifiers for a given client pulled from a db.
Probably very limited in function as adds a lot to complexity.
Dialogs are a good use case.
