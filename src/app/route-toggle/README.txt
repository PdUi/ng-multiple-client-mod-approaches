“routed” Approach
Could be useful where we have same number of pages per client, but each one wants completely different sets of widgets displayed on each page.
Also useful where some of the 'pages' need sub routing to get to the various components.(tabbed layout)
Would need to come from db. Would be part of url, so need to describe layout instead of tying to client name/identifier.
Maintains ‘back button’ functionality.
