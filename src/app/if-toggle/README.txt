“if” Approach
Probably mostly used within components to hide client specific requests.
Could potentially be handled a little bit more upstream where the data isn't even returned to the UI in the first place and missing data would be hidden with this approach.
i.e. columns on a grid, missing data, etc.
Would need to come from db.
